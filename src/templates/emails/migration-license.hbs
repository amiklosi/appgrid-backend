subject: Use AppGrid Outside the App Store - Your License Key
---
Hi there,

Thank you for purchasing AppGrid! We've generated a license key so you can also use AppGrid in the direct download version (outside the App Store).

Your License Key: {{licenseKey}}

{{#if isLifetime}}
This lifetime license never expires and works on up to {{maxActivations}} devices.
{{else}}
This license is valid until {{expirationDate}} and works on up to {{maxActivations}} devices.
{{/if}}

To use it:
1. Download AppGrid directly from our website
2. Open the app and go to Settings
3. Enter your license key to unlock PRO features

Your App Store purchase remains active - this key simply lets you use the same PRO features in the direct download version.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out!

Best regards,
The AppGrid Team
